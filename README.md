This is a simple file directory indexer / lister script written in PHP with some help from JavaScript.

This Indexer is designed to be a more image and video friendly Indexer while still having most of the basic functions of any other Indexer or Directory Lister. It is also designed to have a retro and simple feel to it which is why it doesn't use any fancy CSS or icon packs.

JavaScript is not required for the Indexer but it is needed for the extra functionality.

***You can visit the [demo](https://five.sh/demo/indexer/) to view the indexer in action.***

# Setup
## 1. Files

You can choose between having a default setup and a standalone setup.

The default setup will import assets (`js`, `css` etc) as separate files, like most sites. This is the most orderly setup.

The standalone setup will have all of these files bundled directly into the `.php` file. This may slightly increase the time it takes for the page to load but it usually won't be noticeable at all.

### Default
Place the files from the [/public/](https://github.com/sixem/eyy-indexer/blob/master/public/) directory into your root web directory.
### Standalone (Single file)
Place the file from the [/standalone/](https://github.com/sixem/eyy-indexer/blob/master/standalone/) directory into your root web directory.

## 2. Server Configuration

### Nginx
To use this script for all directories without a default index you need append `/indexer.php` to the end of your `index` line in your server configuration. This will tell Nginx to use the Indexer if none of the default indexes exist.

Example usage:
```
server {
        index index.html index.htm index.php /indexer.php;
}

```
Alternatively, you can only make it work for certain directories:
```
server {
        location ~ ^/(videos|images)/ {
                index /indexer.php;
        }
}

```
### Apache
In order to automatically use this script you need to edit your Apache configuration. To do that you can place this line in your Apache configuration:

```
DirectoryIndex index.php index.html index.htm /indexer.php
```

This line can be placed in either your server's `.conf` file or your `.htaccess` file. This will tell Apache to use the Indexer if none of the default indexes exist.

# Configuration
The Indexer can be customized by editing the config available inside of the [indexer.php](https://github.com/sixem/eyy-indexer/blob/master/public/indexer.php).

You can read the [CONFIG.md](https://github.com/sixem/eyy-indexer/blob/master/CONFIG.md) to see a more detailed overview of the available options.

# Source
The files inside [/.source/](https://github.com/sixem/eyy-indexer/blob/master/.source/) are **NOT** needed in order to run this script.

This directory contains the uncompressed (and untranspiled) source files of the script (.css, .js etc.), so you can use these files if you want to customize or edit the script in any way.
